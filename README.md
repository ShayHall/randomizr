# Randomizr

This is a silly little randomizr where you can add options of words or sentences to four lists.  One entry from each list will randomly be picked.  Each of the selected entries will then be put together into a sentence.  This can be used to create hills, value propositions, haikus, baby names or anything else you can think of.
